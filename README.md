# CSC-300-Assignment-1

Write a menu-driven program, using switch-case, to display the following patterns based on user input.
First, ask the user to enter a number, between 1-4 for the different types of patterns as shown below. Once
the pattern is chosen, ask the user to enter a number between 1-10 to choose the number of lines for the
pattern (for pattern 3, must choose the number of lines to be odd; keep asking user until an odd number is
supplied). When both inputs are received from the user, display the appropriate pattern.
